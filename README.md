# Agricultural Aid From Abroad: The H-2A Visa and US Crop Yields (2010-2020)

Note: This README is a work in progress and will be updated periodically.

## Summary

This capstone project examines the H-2A visa program in relation to domestic crop yields to assess the effect of H-2A workers on American food production.


## General Info

The H-2A visa program allows nonimmigrant foreign workers to come to the US to perform temporary agricultural work for a US employer. This program accounts for the largest number of temporary foreign workers in the US. Employers hire H-2A workers when they are short on domestic agricultural workers for a specific season.

The process begins when the employer files a temporary labor certification (TLC) with the Department of Labor, specifying what type of work they are requesting and proof that they could not find workers in the US to do it. Upon approval, the employer files Form I-129 with USCIS. Once both filings are approved, foreign workers can then apply for jobs offered by an employer with an approved TLC and I-129.

Once hired, foreign workers can apply for the H-2A visa with USCIS and must pass an interview at their local US consulate. Upon approval, the foreign worker can finally come to the US using the H-2A visa and stay until the visa expires.

For this project I will be analyzing TLC entries, visa statistics, crop yields, and unemployment data from 2010 to 2020 (inclusive) to identify any correlations between these topics.


## Motivation

I've always had an interest in immigration related topics, having gone through the immigration process myself without legal assistance. I wanted to learn more about a visa that I wasn't familiar with to understand how other foreigners come to be in the US.


## Data Questions

This project will aim to answer the following questions:

- Where do most H-2A workers come from?
- How does the number of TLC approvals compare to the number of H-2A visas issued?
- Which states request the most H-2A workers? How does this compare to states with the highest crop yields?
- Is there a correlation between the number and job titles of H-2A workers and crop yields, based on job titles including those crops?
- What are the most common jobs for H-2A workers?
- Is there a correlation between the number of H-2A workers per state and state unemployment rate?
