# Agricultural Aid From Abroad: The H-2A Visa and US Crop Yields, 2010-2020

Note: This README is a work in progress and will be updated periodically.

6/21 UPDATE: MVP 95% done, working on formatting touch ups and figuring out what to say on Thursday. Stretch goals may have to be abandoned.


## Summary

This capstone project examines the H-2A visa program in relation to domestic crop yields.


## General Info

The H-2A visa program allows nonimmigrant foreign workers to come to the US to perform temporary agricultural work for a US employer. Employers hire H-2A workers when they are short on domestic agricultural workers for a specific season.

The process begins when the employer files a temporary labor certification (TLC) with the Department of Labor. Once approved, the employer files Form I-129 with USCIS. If both filings are approved, foreign workers can then apply for jobs offered by the employer through an online portal.

Upon being hired, foreign workers can apply for the H-2A visa with USCIS and must pass an interview at their local US consulate before coming to the US. H-2A workers can stay for up to a year depending on the job and must return home by the end of their authorized period of stay.

## Motivation

I've always had an interest in immigration related topics, having gone through the immigration process myself without legal assistance. This topic came about after researching different ways foreigners come to be in the US. Since the H-2A program accounts for the largest number of temporary foreign workers in the US, I wanted to show potential ways they affect the food system through their limited stay.


## Data Questions

**How does the H-2A program relate to crop yields?**

I will focus on 5 crops in particular because they have USDA data from 2010-2020 (inclusive): citrus (grapefruits, lemons, oranges), strawberries, lettuce, potatoes (sweet potatoes, potatoes), and tomatoes.

This project also considers the following questions:

- Where do most H-2A workers come from?
- What are the most common job titles?
- How do TLC approvals compare to H-2A visa approvals?
- Who are the top employers?
- How do workers compare to crop yields?
