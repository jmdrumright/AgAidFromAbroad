# Agricultural Aid From Abroad: The H-2A Visa and US Crop Yields (2010-2020)

The H-2A visa program allows nonimmigrant foreign workers to come to the US to perform temporary agricultural labor for a US employer. Employers hire H-2A workers when they are short on domestic agricultural workers for a specific season.

I'm interested to know how the number and type of H-2A workers correlate with US crop yields. Since many H-2A jobs involve manual labor such as picking produce, I will be using USDA yield data as an indicator of H-2A influence rather than monetary metrics. I will be focusing on data from 2010-2020 to get a wider scope on any potential patterns that may appear across the decade. While there may be correlations found, it's important to note that crop yields can also be affected by drought, invasive species or other factors not related to H-2A workers.

By assessing the H-2A program through yield data, government agencies and H-2A workers can better understand how the labor provided through this program is influencing American food production.

### Data Question

How does the number and job titles of H-2A workers correlate with US crop yields (based on H-2A job titles including those crops)?
